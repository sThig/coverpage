# Personal Website

With all the tools I've learned lately, I'm trying to build my site from memory as best as I can.  This is all for testing purposes and my own personal coding challenge.

#V1.1
* fixed mobile background/video issues
* it responds better now

# V1
* flexbox works
* responsiveness works
* js random generator works (with ES6)


## BUGS
*I have fixed most things*
* can't constantly update the dom using SetInterval, I have tried everything but it doesn't seem to be working very well.
* there are some issues with the movie background for now, will address once I get the html working
